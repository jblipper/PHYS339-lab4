Calibration:
steps = 360 
Frequency = 500kHz

Exercise 3:
Run 0: 4096
Run 1: 1500
Run 2: 1000
Run 3: 1250

Exercise 1:
- Corner with dot is where transmitted intensity is maximized, and so is corner opposite to it
- The side with line removes all light reflected off the floor when it is parallel to the floor. 
	The light reflected off the floor is parallel to line on polarized sheet
	We conclude that it's polarized perp. to line 
- Arrows are pointed along axis of polarization
